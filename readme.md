# Video Catalogue Application

This project is based on the FullCycle Course and aims to develop a small video catalog using TypeScript (NestJS), Go, and React.

## Overview

The main objective of this application is to provide a catalog of videos, where users can browse, search, and interact with the video content. The project is structured in a microservices architecture, with each service handling specific parts of the application. We leverage the strengths of TypeScript with NestJS, Go for high-performance operations, and React for a responsive front-end experience.
Technologies

**Backend**:
**NestJS (TypeScript)**: For building the core server-side logic, including API endpoints, authentication, and business logic.

**Go**: Used for specific microservices that require performance optimization.

**Frontend**:
**React**: Responsible for delivering a dynamic and interactive user interface, enhancing the user experience.

## Key Features

**Microservices Architecture**: The application is divided into several independent services to ensure scalability and maintainability.
**REST API**: A well-defined API for interacting with the video catalog, including endpoints for managing videos, categories, and user actions.
**TypeScript Support**: Ensures strong typing and enhances development productivity with improved tooling.
**High-Performance Go Services**: Go microservices are optimized for handling tasks like video processing or other resource-intensive operations.
**Responsive UI**: React is used to create a modern, fast, and mobile-friendly user interface.
